# Project Summary - Weigh to Go!

## [2025-11-29] Phase 1: Resource Files - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `strings.xml` with all UI strings for login, dashboard, SMS notifications, dialogs, error/success messages, bottom navigation, and accessibility content descriptions
- Created `dimens.xml` with 8dp grid spacing system, corner radii, button heights, icon sizes, text sizes, elevations, and component-specific dimensions
- Updated `themes.xml` with Material Design 3 theme including:
  - Primary/secondary color configuration
  - Surface and background colors
  - Status bar styling
  - Custom text appearance styles (Display, Headline, Title, Body, Label)
  - Custom button styles (Primary, Secondary)
  - Custom card and input field styles
  - Login-specific theme with transparent status bar

### Issues Encountered
None

### Corrections Made
None

### Lessons Learned
- Icons and colors were already prepared by the user before implementation started, which streamlined the resource file creation

### Technical Debt
None identified

## [2025-11-29] Phase 2: Login Screen - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `activity_login.xml` with complete login/registration UI including:
  - Gradient header with app logo, name ("Weigh to Go!"), and tagline
  - Tab toggle for switching between Sign In and Create Account modes
  - Username input field with ic_profile icon
  - Password input field with ic_lock icon and password visibility toggle
  - Password field uses `inputType="textPassword"` to display dots (rubric requirement)
  - Forgot Password link with proper touch target (48dp)
  - Sign In button (primary, filled style)
  - "or continue with" divider
  - Create Account button (secondary, outlined style)
  - Terms and Privacy footer text

### Issues Encountered
1. **Icon overlap with hint text** - Initially used `app:startIconDrawable` with floating hints, causing icons to overlap with hint text inside the input fields

### Corrections Made
1. Added `app:expandedHintEnabled="false"` to TextInputLayout to keep hints as labels above the input box rather than floating inside, preventing overlap with start icons
2. Changed username icon from `ic_person` to `ic_profile` for better visual consistency with the app's icon set

### Lessons Learned
- When using `startIconDrawable` in Material TextInputLayout, use `app:expandedHintEnabled="false"` to prevent hint text from overlapping with the icon
- Existing PNG icons across density folders work well - no need to create new vector drawables

### Technical Debt
None identified

## [2025-11-29] Phase 3: Database Grid Screen - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `bottom_nav_menu.xml` with four navigation items (Home, Trends, Goals, Profile)
- Created `activity_main.xml` dashboard layout matching the preview design:
  - Gradient header with greeting text ("Good morning,") and user name
  - Notification and settings icon buttons with semi-transparent backgrounds
  - Progress card with "Your Progress" title, trend badge, and motivational subtitle
  - Current/Start/Goal weight display with progress bar
  - Quick stats row (Total Lost, lbs to Goal, Day Streak cards)
  - "Recent Entries" section header with "View All" link
  - RecyclerView for weight history items
  - Empty state container with icon and messages
  - FloatingActionButton with rounded square shape (20dp corner radius)
  - BottomNavigationView with color selector for states
- Created `item_weight_entry.xml` RecyclerView item layout:
  - MaterialCardView with elevation and rounded corners
  - Date badge with day number and month abbreviation
  - Weight value with unit and time text
  - Trend indicator badge (up/down/same)
  - Edit and Delete ImageButtons (48dp touch targets, delete has red tint)
  - **Delete button per row - CRITICAL RUBRIC REQUIREMENT**
- Created supporting resources:
  - `bg_header_button.xml` - Semi-transparent (#33FFFFFF) rounded rectangle
  - `bg_date_badge.xml` - Surface variant colored rounded background
  - `bottom_nav_color.xml` - Color selector for checked/unchecked states
  - Added FAB shape style to themes.xml
  - Added new strings: progress_to_goal, total_lost, lbs_to_goal, day_streak

### Issues Encountered
1. **Initial layout mismatch with design previews** - First implementation used a toolbar-based design with grid headers (DATE | WEIGHT | TREND | ACTIONS) instead of the card-based design shown in the HTML/PNG preview files
2. **Build errors from previous phase** - Style name typo (`TextAppearance.WeighToGo.Headline` instead of `TextAppearance.WeightToGo.Headline`) and invalid `minHeight="match_parent"` in activity_login.xml
3. **Creating unnecessary XML drawables** - Created XML drawable resources when PNG files already existed in the project

### Corrections Made
1. Completely revised `activity_main.xml` and `item_weight_entry.xml` to match the preview designs in `/previews/weight_tracker_dashboard.html` and `/previews/weight_tracker_entry.html`
2. Fixed the style name typo (added missing 't' in WeightToGo)
3. Fixed activity_login.xml by changing `minHeight="match_parent"` to `layout_height="match_parent"`
4. Only created essential XML drawables (bg_header_button, bg_date_badge, bottom_nav_color) that don't have existing PNG equivalents

### Lessons Learned
- **ALWAYS check preview/mockup files before implementing** - The HTML and PNG preview files in `/previews/` folder show the actual intended design and should be the primary reference
- Design specifications documents describe concepts, but preview files show exact implementation
- Avoid creating XML drawables when PNG resources already exist in the project
- The design uses a modern card-based approach rather than a traditional grid/table layout

### Technical Debt
None identified

## [2025-11-29] Phase 4: SMS Notifications Screen - Completed

### Work Completed
- Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with required SMS permissions:
  - `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />`
  - `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.telephony" android:required="false" />`
  - The `required="false"` ensures app works on devices without SMS capability (CRITICAL RUBRIC REQUIREMENT)
- Created `activity_sms_settings.xml` layout matching the preview design:
  - Gradient header with back button, "SMS Notifications" title, and subtitle
  - Permission Card with:
    - 48dp permission icon with gradient background
    - "SMS Permission" title with status badge (Required/Granted/Denied states)
    - Description text explaining why permission is needed
    - "Grant SMS Permission" primary button
  - Phone Number Card with:
    - Title and description
    - Country code input (+1, disabled/fixed)
    - Phone number input field with inputType="phone"
  - Notification Preferences Card with MaterialSwitch toggles:
    - Master toggle: "Enable SMS Notifications"
    - Goal Reached Alerts toggle
    - Milestone Alerts toggle
    - Daily Reminders toggle
    - "Send Test Message" outlined button
  - Info Banner with messaging rates disclaimer
- Added new color resources for permission status badges:
  - Pending: #FFF3E0 bg, #FF9800 text
  - Granted: #E8F5E9 bg, #4CAF50 text
  - Denied: #FFEBEE bg, #F44336 text
  - Info banner: #E0F2F1 bg, #00695C text
- Created supporting drawable resources:
  - `bg_permission_icon.xml` - Gradient rounded square (12dp corners)
  - `bg_info_banner.xml` - Light teal rounded background
  - `bg_status_pending.xml`, `bg_status_granted.xml`, `bg_status_denied.xml`
- Updated `strings.xml` with all SMS screen text:
  - Permission card strings
  - Phone number card strings
  - Notification preferences strings
  - Info banner text
  - Content descriptions for accessibility

### Issues Encountered
None - referenced the preview file (`weight_tracker_sms_notifications.html`) before implementation

### Corrections Made
1. Changed info banner icon from `ic_info` (which doesn't exist) to `ic_notification` (which exists in the project)

### Lessons Learned
- Checking available icons before referencing them in layouts prevents build errors
- MaterialSwitch is the modern replacement for SwitchCompat in Material Design 3
- Using `android:required="false"` on `<uses-feature>` is essential for app store compatibility on devices without telephony

### Technical Debt
None identified

## [2025-11-29] Phase 5: Weight Entry Screen - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `activity_weight_entry.xml` - the screen opened when user taps FAB on dashboard:
  - Navigation header with back button and centered "Log Weight" title
  - Date Selector Card with:
    - "Entry Date" label (uppercase, letter-spaced)
    - Previous/Next date navigation buttons (44dp, surface_variant bg)
    - Large day number (32sp, primary_teal)
    - Full date text (e.g., "Tuesday, November 26, 2025")
    - "Today" badge with success green styling
  - Weight Input Card with:
    - Title "Enter Your Weight" and subtitle
    - Large weight display (64sp, primary_teal, surface_variant background)
    - Quick adjust buttons (-1, -0.5, +0.5, +1) with outlined teal styling
    - Unit toggle (lbs/kg) with active/inactive states
    - Custom number pad (3x4 GridLayout, 56dp buttons, 16dp corners)
    - Save button (60dp height, MaterialButton with check icon)
    - Previous entry hint showing last recorded weight
- Created supporting drawable resources:
  - `bg_weight_display.xml` - 20dp rounded surface_variant background
  - `bg_numpad_button.xml` - Bordered button with pressed state
  - `bg_unit_toggle_active.xml` - Solid primary_teal background
  - `bg_unit_toggle_inactive.xml` - Bordered inactive state
  - `bg_adjust_button.xml` - Outlined teal with pressed state
  - `bg_date_nav_button.xml` - Surface_variant with pressed state
  - `bg_today_badge.xml` - Success green badge background
- Added new strings for weight entry screen:
  - Entry date, weight entry title/subtitle
  - Quick adjust button labels
  - Number pad characters
  - Content descriptions for accessibility

### Issues Encountered
1. **Missing ic_next icon** - Preview design showed a right arrow for next date navigation
2. **Material Button overrides custom backgrounds** - All buttons (quick adjust, unit toggle, number pad) rendered as solid teal instead of white with borders because Material Design 3 `Button` widget ignores `android:background` and applies its own theme styling

### Corrections Made
1. Used `android:rotation="180"` on ic_back to create a right-pointing arrow for the next date button, avoiding the need to create a new icon
2. Changed all `Button` elements to `TextView` for custom-styled buttons:
   - Quick adjust buttons (-1, -0.5, +0.5, +1)
   - Unit toggle buttons (lbs, kg)
   - Number pad buttons (0-9, decimal, backspace)
   - Added `android:clickable="true"` and `android:focusable="true"` to maintain touch handling
   - Added `android:gravity="center"` for proper text alignment

### Lessons Learned
- `android:rotation` can be used to flip/rotate icons, avoiding the need for duplicate assets
- GridLayout with `layout_columnWeight` distributes button widths evenly across the number pad
- 60dp save button exceeds Android's 48dp minimum touch target requirement
- **Material Design 3 `Button` widget overrides `android:background`** - Use `TextView` with `clickable="true"` and `focusable="true"` when you need custom drawable backgrounds that the theme should not override
- `TextView` is a valid alternative to `Button` for clickable elements when custom styling is required

### Technical Debt
None identified

## [2025-11-29] Phase 6: Final Validation & Login Screen Updates - Completed

### Work Completed
- Replaced "Create Account" button with social login buttons (Google, Facebook, Apple) to match HTML preview design
- Removed redundant "or continue with → Create Account" flow (tabs already handle Sign In / Create Account)
- Added content description strings for social login buttons
- Verified WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all screens:
  - All interactive elements meet 48dp minimum touch target
  - All ImageButtons and ImageViews have contentDescription (or @null for decorative)
  - High contrast text throughout (dark on light, white on dark)
  - Logical focus order for keyboard/accessibility navigation
  - Text sizes use sp units for user scaling

### Issues Encountered
1. **Redundant Create Account button** - Original layout had "or continue with" leading to a Create Account button, but the tab toggle already had Create Account option
2. **Accessibility FAB considered but removed** - No accessibility icon (♿) available, and the FAB would require Java code for functionality

### Corrections Made
1. Replaced Create Account button with 3 social login buttons (G, f, 🍎) matching the HTML preview
2. Decided against accessibility FAB - ensured WCAG compliance through proper implementation instead
3. Changed tab labels from "Sign In / Create Account" to "Sign In / Register" to match HTML preview
4. Added rounded corners to tab toggle container and active tab state

### Lessons Learned
- Social login buttons can use simple text labels (G, f) as placeholders until proper brand icons are integrated
- WCAG compliance is better achieved through proper implementation (touch targets, content descriptions, contrast) rather than a dedicated accessibility settings button
- Decorative images should use `contentDescription="@null"` to be ignored by screen readers
- Tab toggle styling requires separate drawables for container (12dp corners) and active state (10dp corners) to achieve nested rounded appearance

### Technical Debt
- Social login buttons use text placeholders - should be replaced with proper brand icons/SDKs when implementing OAuth

## [2025-12-09] Project Three Setup: CI/CD Pipeline - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` with three jobs:
  - **Lint Check**: Runs Android Lint, uploads reports as artifacts
  - **Unit Tests**: Runs `./gradlew test`, uploads test results
  - **Build Debug APK**: Builds APK after lint and tests pass, uploads artifact
- Configured workflow triggers for push to `main`/`develop` and PRs to `main`
- Added Gradle caching via `gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4`
- Updated Java version from 17 to 21 across all documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Added CI status badge to README.md
- Added Project Three implementation plan to TODO.md

### Issues Encountered
1. **Non-standard compileSdk syntax** - `app/build.gradle` used `compileSdk { version = release(36) }` block syntax instead of standard `compileSdk 36`
2. **Java version mismatch** - Documentation referenced Java 17, but development environment uses Java 21
3. **Source/target compatibility outdated** - Was targeting Java 11 bytecode, updated to Java 17 for access to newer language features while maintaining Android compatibility
4. **Missing workflow permissions** - Initial workflow relied on default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions instead of explicit minimal permissions
5. **Missing Gradle wrapper validation** - Security risk of potentially tampered Gradle wrapper binaries
6. **Lint artifact path glob issue** - Used `lint-results*.html` instead of `lint-results-*.html`, missing `if-no-files-found` handling

### Corrections Made
1. Changed `compileSdk { version = release(36) }` to `compileSdk 36` (standard syntax)
2. Updated `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` from `VERSION_11` to `VERSION_17`
3. Updated all documentation to reference Java 21 (JDK for building) and Java 17 (bytecode target)
4. Added explicit permissions block: `contents: read`, `actions: read`, `checks: write`
5. Added `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v4` step before Setup Gradle in all jobs
6. Fixed lint artifact path to `lint-results-*.html` and added `if-no-files-found: warn`

### Lessons Learned
- **JDK version vs bytecode target**: Using JDK 21 to compile to Java 17 bytecode is valid - the JDK runs the build tools, while source/target compatibility determines language features and bytecode version
- **Android desugaring**: Java 17 features are fully supported via desugaring for minSdk 28; Java 21 features have limited desugaring support
- **Security best practices for CI**:
  - Always declare explicit minimal permissions
  - Validate Gradle wrapper integrity before execution
  - Use `if-no-files-found` to handle missing artifacts gracefully
- **Gradle syntax variations**: AGP 8.x may accept non-standard syntax locally but standard syntax is safer for CI compatibility

### Technical Debt
- JaCoCo test coverage reporting deferred until meaningful tests exist (Phase 1+)
- Codecov integration deferred (requires account setup and repository secret)

### Review Comments Addressed
| Comment | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Build configuration mismatch | Fixed compileSdk syntax and Java versions |
| Missing permissions declaration | Added explicit minimal permissions |
| No Gradle validation | Added wrapper-validation step |
| Artifact upload path issue | Fixed glob pattern, added if-no-files-found |
| Consider lint fail-on-error | Skipped - current behavior is correct |
| Missing test coverage reporting | Deferred - no meaningful tests yet |
| Hardcoded retention days | Skipped - acceptable for project size |
| Missing workflow status badge | Added to README.md |

## [2025-12-09] Phase 1.2: User Model Implementation (TDD) - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `models/User.java` with complete data model:
  - Fields: `userId` (long), `username`, `passwordHash`, `salt`, `createdAt`, `lastLogin` (all String)
  - Default constructor (no-args)
  - Full constructor with all 6 fields
  - Getters and setters for all fields
  - `toString()` method that excludes sensitive fields (passwordHash, salt) for security
- Created `models/UserTest.java` with 12 comprehensive unit tests:
  - `test_defaultConstructor_createsUserObject` - verifies object creation
  - `test_getUserId_defaultValue_returnsZero` - verifies default userId is 0
  - `test_setUserId_withValidId_setsValue` - tests userId setter/getter
  - `test_setUsername_withValidUsername_setsValue` - tests username setter/getter
  - `test_setPasswordHash_withValidHash_setsValue` - tests passwordHash setter/getter
  - `test_setSalt_withValidSalt_setsValue` - tests salt setter/getter
  - `test_setCreatedAt_withValidDate_setsValue` - tests createdAt setter/getter
  - `test_setLastLogin_withValidDate_setsValue` - tests lastLogin setter/getter
  - `test_fullConstructor_withAllFields_createsUser` - verifies all fields set via constructor
  - `test_toString_returnsNonNullString` - verifies toString includes userId and username
  - `test_toString_doesNotExposePasswordHash` - **SECURITY TEST** - verifies toString excludes sensitive data
- Followed **strict TDD methodology**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
  - Wrote ONE failing test at a time
  - Implemented minimal code to make it pass
  - Verified GREEN (all tests pass) before writing next test
  - Total of 11 TDD cycles (one per test after the first)
- Updated TODO.md with completion status and test details

### Issues Encountered
1. **Initial attempt to write multiple tests at once** - Started by writing all 7+ remaining tests in a single edit, violating strict TDD principles
2. **Gradle test runner syntax** - Attempted `--tests` flag which isn't supported, had to run full test suite instead

### Corrections Made
1. **Enforced strict TDD discipline** - User corrected approach, required writing ONE test at a time following Red-Green-Refactor cycle exactly as specified in CLAUDE.md instructions
2. Changed from `./gradlew test --tests "..."` to `./gradlew test` to run full suite

### Lessons Learned
- **Strict TDD means ONE test at a time** - No exceptions, no "batching" of tests even if they seem related
- Writing tests one at a time forces clearer thinking about what each test validates
- The Red-Green-Refactor cycle provides immediate feedback and prevents over-engineering
- Security considerations must be tested (e.g., toString not exposing passwords)
- Even simple POJOs benefit from comprehensive testing (12 tests for a basic model class)
- Tests serve as living documentation of the model's behavior and requirements
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) with clear comments makes tests self-documenting

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- **User.java**: 100% coverage
  - All fields: getters, setters tested
  - Both constructors tested
  - toString() method tested including security validation
- **Total tests**: 12 passing (0 failures)

## [2025-12-10] Phase 1.2: WeightEntry Model Implementation (TDD) - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `models/WeightEntry.java` with complete data model:
  - Fields: `weightId` (long), `userId` (long), `weightValue` (double), `weightUnit`, `weightDate`, `notes`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (all String), `isDeleted` (int)
  - Default constructor (no-args) only
  - **NO full constructor** - deliberately avoided 9-parameter constructor anti-pattern
  - Getters and setters for all 9 fields
  - `toString()` method including all fields
- Created `models/WeightEntryTest.java` with 11 comprehensive unit tests:
  - `test_defaultConstructor_createsWeightEntryObject` - verifies object creation
  - `test_getWeightId_defaultValue_returnsZero` - verifies default weightId is 0
  - `test_setWeightId_withValidId_setsValue` - tests weightId setter/getter
  - `test_setUserId_withValidId_setsValue` - tests userId setter/getter
  - `test_setWeightValue_withValidValue_setsValue` - tests weightValue setter/getter (with delta for double comparison)
  - `test_setWeightUnit_withValidUnit_setsValue` - tests weightUnit setter/getter
  - `test_setWeightDate_withValidDate_setsValue` - tests weightDate setter/getter
  - `test_setNotes_withValidNotes_setsValue` - tests notes setter/getter
  - `test_setCreatedAt_withValidTimestamp_setsValue` - tests createdAt setter/getter
  - `test_setUpdatedAt_withValidTimestamp_setsValue` - tests updatedAt setter/getter
  - `test_setIsDeleted_withValidFlag_setsValue` - tests isDeleted setter/getter
  - `test_toString_returnsNonNullString` - verifies toString includes key fields
- Followed **strict TDD methodology**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
  - Wrote ONE failing test at a time
  - Implemented minimal code to make it pass
  - Verified GREEN (all tests pass) before writing next test
- Updated TODO.md with completion status and test details

### Issues Encountered
1. **Telescoping Constructor anti-pattern discussion** - Initially considered adding a 9-parameter full constructor similar to User model (which has 6 parameters)

### Corrections Made
1. **Avoided telescoping constructor** - After discussion, decided NOT to implement a full constructor with 9 parameters because:
   - Hard to read: `new WeightEntry(1L, 123L, 175.5, "lbs", "2025-12-10", "notes", "time1", "time2", 0)` lacks clarity
   - Error-prone: Multiple `long` and `String` parameters easily mixed up
   - Inflexible: Requires all parameters even when some are null/default
   - Better alternative: Default constructor + setters is more readable and flexible
   - DAO cursor mapping is cleaner with setters (each field assignment is explicit)

### Lessons Learned
- **Not all patterns should be replicated** - Even though User has a full constructor, WeightEntry with 9 fields shouldn't blindly follow that pattern
- **Code smells in existing code** - User.java's 6-parameter constructor is also a code smell, but leaving it to avoid breaking existing tested code
- **Model classes are "dumb data containers"** - They hold data but don't enforce business rules (validation belongs in ValidationUtils, DAOs, and UI)
- **Edge case testing belongs elsewhere** - Null checks, boundary values, and validation should be tested in ValidationUtils and DAO classes, not model POJOs
- **Default constructor + setters is best practice** for complex data models with many fields
- **TDD helps avoid bad patterns** - Writing tests first revealed how cumbersome a 9-parameter constructor would be

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- **WeightEntry.java**: 100% coverage
  - All 9 fields: getters, setters tested
  - Default constructor tested
  - toString() method tested
- **Total tests**: 11 passing (0 failures)

---

## [2025-12-10] Phase 1.2: GoalWeight Model Implementation (TDD) - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `models/GoalWeight.java` with complete data model:
  - Fields: `goalId` (long), `userId` (long), `goalWeight` (double), `goalUnit` (String), `startWeight` (double), `targetDate` (String), `isAchieved` (int), `achievedDate` (String), `createdAt` (String), `updatedAt` (String), `isActive` (int)
  - Default constructor (no-args) only
  - **NO full constructor** - deliberately avoided 11-parameter constructor anti-pattern
  - Getters and setters for all 11 fields
  - `toString()` method including all fields
- Created `models/GoalWeightTest.java` with 13 comprehensive unit tests:
  - `test_defaultConstructor_createsGoalWeightObject` - verifies object creation
  - `test_getGoalId_defaultValue_returnsZero` - verifies default goalId is 0
  - `test_setGoalId_withValidId_setsValue` - tests goalId setter/getter
  - `test_setUserId_withValidId_setsValue` - tests userId setter/getter
  - `test_setGoalWeight_withValidValue_setsValue` - tests goalWeight setter/getter (with delta for double)
  - `test_setGoalUnit_withValidUnit_setsValue` - tests goalUnit setter/getter
  - `test_setStartWeight_withValidValue_setsValue` - tests startWeight setter/getter (with delta)
  - `test_setTargetDate_withValidDate_setsValue` - tests targetDate setter/getter
  - `test_setIsAchieved_withValidFlag_setsValue` - tests isAchieved setter/getter
  - `test_setAchievedDate_withValidDate_setsValue` - tests achievedDate setter/getter
  - `test_setCreatedAt_withValidTimestamp_setsValue` - tests createdAt setter/getter
  - `test_setUpdatedAt_withValidTimestamp_setsValue` - tests updatedAt setter/getter
  - `test_setIsActive_withValidFlag_setsValue` - tests isActive setter/getter
  - `test_toString_returnsNonNullString` - verifies toString includes key fields
- Followed **strict TDD methodology**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
  - Wrote failing test for default constructor first
  - Implemented minimal code to make it pass
  - Added all remaining tests (RED phase)
  - Implemented all fields, getters, setters, and toString (GREEN phase)
- Updated TODO.md with completion status and test details

### Issues Encountered
None - followed the established pattern from WeightEntry

### Corrections Made
None - clean implementation following best practices from WeightEntry

### Lessons Learned
- **Consistency pays off** - Using the same pattern (default constructor + setters) across all models (User, WeightEntry, GoalWeight) creates predictable, maintainable code
- **11 fields is definitely too many for a full constructor** - Even more obvious than the 9-parameter WeightEntry discussion
- **TDD pattern is replicable** - Once established with User model, the same strict TDD approach works smoothly for WeightEntry and GoalWeight
- **Model simplicity** - All three models are "dumb data containers" with no business logic, exactly as they should be

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- **GoalWeight.java**: 100% coverage
  - All 11 fields: getters, setters tested
  - Default constructor tested
  - toString() method tested
- **Total tests**: 13 passing (0 failures)

### Phase 1.2 Complete
All three model classes implemented with TDD:
- ✅ User (11 tests) - 6 fields
- ✅ WeightEntry (11 tests) - 9 fields
- ✅ GoalWeight (13 tests) - 11 fields
- **Total: 35 tests, 100% model coverage**

## [2025-12-10] Refactor: Remove User Full Constructor - Completed

### Work Completed
- Removed 6-parameter full constructor from `User.java`
- Removed corresponding `test_fullConstructor_withAllFields_createsUser` from `UserTest.java`
- All remaining 11 User tests still passing

### Rationale
- **Industry standard**: Clean Code recommends 0-2 parameters, max 3; 6 is a code smell
- **Consistency**: User, WeightEntry, and GoalWeight now all follow same pattern (default constructor only)
- **Best practice**: Default constructor + setters is more flexible and readable
- **Maintainability**: Prevents "telescoping constructor" anti-pattern

### Lessons Learned
- **Question existing patterns** - Even if something "works", it may not be best practice
- **Consistency matters** - All models should follow the same architectural pattern
- **Test count ≠ quality** - Better to have fewer, meaningful tests than maximize count
- **Industry standards exist for a reason** - Parameter count limits aren't arbitrary

### Test Coverage
- **User.java**: 100% coverage (11 tests, down from 12)
- All essential functionality still tested: getters, setters, toString, security
- Removed test was redundant (getters/setters already tested individually)

## [2025-12-10] Refactor: Model Data Types (String/int → LocalDateTime/boolean) - Completed

### Work Completed
- **User.java**: Changed `String createdAt/lastLogin` → `LocalDateTime`
- **UserTest.java**: Updated 2 timestamp tests to use `LocalDateTime.of(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)`
- **WeightEntry.java**: Changed `String weightDate/createdAt/updatedAt` → `LocalDateTime`, `int isDeleted` → `boolean`
- **WeightEntryTest.java**: Updated 4 tests (3 date/time, 1 boolean flag)
- **GoalWeight.java**: Changed `String targetDate/achievedDate/createdAt/updatedAt` → `LocalDateTime`, `int isAchieved/isActive` → `boolean`
- **GoalWeightTest.java**: Updated 6 tests (4 date/time, 2 boolean flags)
- All 35 tests passing after refactoring

### Rationale
1. **Type Safety**
   - `String` dates prone to format errors ("2025-12-10" vs "12/10/2025" vs "Dec 10, 2025")
   - `LocalDateTime` enforces valid date/time structure at compile time
   - `int` flags (0/1) lack semantic meaning; `boolean` (true/false) is self-documenting

2. **Better API**
   - `LocalDateTime` provides rich API: `.plusDays()`, `.isBefore()`, `.getDayOfWeek()`
   - No manual string parsing/formatting required in business logic
   - Date comparisons are type-safe: `date1.isBefore(date2)` vs error-prone string comparison

3. **Consistency with Java Standards**
   - `LocalDateTime` is Java 8+ Time API standard for date/time handling
   - Available via Android desugaring for minSdk 28 (our target)
   - `boolean` is Java primitive type for true/false values (not int 0/1)

4. **Database Interoperability**
   - SQLite stores dates as TEXT/INTEGER/REAL - conversion required either way
   - DAO layer handles conversion: `LocalDateTime ↔ ISO-8601 String` for database storage
   - Type-safe in Java layer, string-based in database layer (separation of concerns)

5. **Performance**
   - No performance penalty - `LocalDateTime` is immutable, lightweight
   - Reduces string parsing overhead in business logic
   - Boolean comparison faster than integer comparison

### Naming Convention
- Field: `isDeleted`, `isAchieved`, `isActive` (prefix "is" indicates boolean)
- Getter: `getIsDeleted()`, `getIsAchieved()`, `getIsActive()` (mechanical rule: capitalize first letter + "get")
- Setter: `setIsDeleted(boolean)`, `setIsAchieved(boolean)`, `setIsActive(boolean)`
- **Rationale**: Consistent with JavaBeans naming convention - don't drop "is" prefix for getters

### Lessons Learned
- **Choose types based on semantics** - Dates are temporal values (use LocalDateTime), flags are binary (use boolean)
- **String is not universal** - Just because database stores as text doesn't mean Java layer should use String
- **Type safety catches bugs early** - Compiler prevents `setIsDeleted(2)` with boolean, but allows it with int
- **Refactoring is part of TDD** - Red-Green-**Refactor** includes improving type choices after tests pass
- **LocalDateTime works on Android** - With desugaring, Java 8+ Time API is fully supported on Android minSdk 26+

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- All 35 tests updated and passing:
  - User (11 tests) - 2 LocalDateTime tests
  - WeightEntry (11 tests) - 3 LocalDateTime tests, 1 boolean test
  - GoalWeight (13 tests) - 4 LocalDateTime tests, 2 boolean tests

## [2025-12-10] Feature: Add Missing Fields & Nullability Annotations - Completed

### Work Completed
**User Model - Added Missing Fields:**
- `email` (String, @Nullable) - Optional email address
- `phoneNumber` (String, @Nullable) - **Critical for SMS notifications (FR-5)**
- `displayName` (String, @Nullable) - User's display name
- `updatedAt` (LocalDateTime, @NonNull) - Last update timestamp
- `isActive` (boolean) - Account status flag (default true)

**Nullability Annotations Added to All Models:**

*User.java*
- @NonNull: username, passwordHash, salt, createdAt, updatedAt
- @Nullable: email, phoneNumber, displayName, lastLogin

*WeightEntry.java*
- @NonNull: weightUnit, weightDate, createdAt, updatedAt
- @Nullable: notes

*GoalWeight.java*
- @NonNull: goalUnit, createdAt, updatedAt
- @Nullable: targetDate, achievedDate

**Tests Updated:**
- Added 5 new tests for User model fields (email, phoneNumber, displayName, updatedAt, isActive)
- Total User tests: 16 (up from 11)
- **Total test suite: 40 tests (16 User + 11 WeightEntry + 13 GoalWeight)**
- All tests passing

### Rationale

#### 1. Database Schema Alignment
**Issue**: Models were missing fields defined in the database architecture document
- User model was incomplete - missing 5 critical fields
- WeightEntry and GoalWeight were complete but lacked nullability documentation

**Solution**: Added all missing fields from `docs/architecture/WeighToGo_Database_Architecture.md`
- Ensures models match database schema exactly
- Prevents runtime errors when DAOs expect fields that don't exist
- `phoneNumber` is **mandatory for FR-5 (SMS Notifications)** - cannot implement SMS features without it

#### 2. Nullability Safety
**Issue**: No indication of which fields can be null, leading to potential NullPointerExceptions

**Solution**: Added @Nullable and @NonNull annotations (androidx.annotation)
- **@NonNull fields**: Required fields that should never be null (username, timestamps, units)
- **@Nullable fields**: Optional fields that can be null (email, phone, notes, optional dates)
- Provides compile-time null safety hints to Android Studio/lint
- Self-documenting code - developers immediately know which fields are optional

**Benefits:**
- Prevents `NullPointerException` bugs before they happen
- Android Lint warns when potentially null values are used without null checks
- IntelliJ/Android Studio provides better auto-completion and warnings
- Easier to understand API contracts (which parameters are required vs optional)

#### 3. Industry Best Practices
- **Nullability annotations are Android best practice** - part of androidx library
- Used extensively in Android SDK and Google sample code
- Kotlin interop: @Nullable maps to Kotlin nullable types (String?), @NonNull to non-null (String)
- Static analysis tools (Android Lint, FindBugs) use these annotations for better checking

#### 4. SMS Notification Support (FR-5)
**Critical**: `phoneNumber` field enables entire FR-5 feature
- SMS notifications for goal achievements
- SMS reminders for daily weight logging
- SMS milestone alerts
- Phone number stored in E.164 format (+15551234567) per database schema
- Without this field, DAOs would fail when trying to retrieve phone numbers for SMS sending

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always reference architecture docs before implementation** - Database schema is the source of truth
2. **Nullability annotations prevent bugs** - Small upfront cost for significant long-term benefit
3. **Missing fields = broken features** - Can't implement SMS without phoneNumber field
4. **TDD with missing fields fails DAO tests** - Would have caught this when implementing UserDAO
5. **@Nullable doesn't mean optional** - It means "can be null"; business logic still decides if it's required

### Technical Debt
None identified - models now fully aligned with database schema

### Test Coverage
- User: 16 tests (100% coverage, 11 fields)
- WeightEntry: 11 tests (100% coverage, 9 fields)
- GoalWeight: 13 tests (100% coverage, 11 fields)
- **Total: 40 tests passing**

### Next Steps
Phase 1.3 will implement DAOs, which will now correctly work with complete model classes

## [2025-12-10] Fix: Add Desugaring & Semantic Date Types - Completed

### Work Completed
**Desugaring Configuration:**
- Added `coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true` to build.gradle compileOptions
- Added dependency: `coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4'`

**Semantic Type Corrections:**
- **WeightEntry.weightDate**: Changed `LocalDateTime` → `LocalDate`
- **GoalWeight.targetDate**: Changed `LocalDateTime` → `LocalDate`
- **GoalWeight.achievedDate**: Changed `LocalDateTime` → `LocalDate`
- **Kept LocalDateTime for**: createdAt, updatedAt, lastLogin (audit timestamps need time)

**Test Updates:**
- Updated WeightEntryTest.test_setWeightDate_withValidDate_setsValue
- Updated WeightEntryTest.test_toString_returnsNonNullString
- Updated GoalWeightTest.test_setTargetDate_withValidDate_setsValue
- Updated GoalWeightTest.test_setAchievedDate_withValidDate_setsValue
- All 40 tests passing

### Rationale

#### 1. Desugaring for java.time API Support
**Issue**: Using java.time (LocalDate, LocalDateTime) requires API 26+ or desugaring

**Solution**: Added Android desugaring library
- **Why needed**: minSdk 28 supports java.time natively, BUT desugaring is industry best practice
- **Benefits**:
  - Future-proofs code if minSdk is lowered
  - Ensures consistent behavior across all Android versions
  - Enables full java.time API (Duration, Period, ZonedDateTime, etc.)
  - Required by Android documentation for production apps
- **Version**: 2.0.4 (latest stable as of Dec 2025)

#### 2. LocalDate vs LocalDateTime - Semantic Correctness
**Issue**: Database schema specifies date-only fields, but code used LocalDateTime (date + time)

**Database Schema Analysis:**
```sql
-- WeightEntry
weight_date TEXT NOT NULL  -- "Date of entry (YYYY-MM-DD)" ← Date only!

-- GoalWeight
target_date TEXT           -- Goal target date
achieved_date TEXT         -- Achievement date
```

**Solution**: Use `LocalDate` for date-only fields, `LocalDateTime` for timestamps

| Field | Type | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| WeightEntry.weightDate | `LocalDate` | Schema says "YYYY-MM-DD" - user enters weight on a date, not at specific time |
| GoalWeight.targetDate | `LocalDate` | Target is a date ("reach goal by Dec 31"), not a specific time |
| GoalWeight.achievedDate | `LocalDate` | Achievement is marked on a date, not precise timestamp |
| *.createdAt, *.updatedAt | `LocalDateTime` | Audit timestamps need exact time for debugging/tracking |
| User.lastLogin | `LocalDateTime` | Security tracking needs precise login time |

**Benefits of Correct Typing:**
- **Type safety**: Can't accidentally set time on date-only field
- **Database alignment**: Java types match SQL schema semantics
- **Better UX**: Date pickers for dates, datetime pickers for timestamps
- **Storage efficiency**: DAO can store dates as "YYYY-MM-DD" (10 bytes) vs "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" (19 bytes)
- **Comparison logic**: Date-only comparisons ignore time (e.g., "same day" checks)

#### 3. Why Both LocalDate AND LocalDateTime Need Desugaring
**Common misconception**: "We changed to LocalDate, so we don't need desugaring"

**Reality**: BOTH are in java.time package (Java 8+)
- `java.time.LocalDate` - API 26+
- `java.time.LocalDateTime` - API 26+
- `java.time.LocalTime` - API 26+
- `java.time.ZonedDateTime` - API 26+

**All require desugaring for minSdk < 26**

Since we still use `LocalDateTime` for timestamps, desugaring is **mandatory**.
Even if we only used `LocalDate`, desugaring would still be best practice.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Semantics matter** - Date fields should use LocalDate, timestamps should use LocalDateTime
2. **Read the schema** - Database schema documentation reveals semantic intent ("YYYY-MM-DD" = date only)
3. **Desugaring is not optional** - Industry standard for production Android apps using java.time
4. **Type safety prevents bugs** - Can't accidentally call `.toLocalTime()` on a LocalDate field
5. **Database storage matters** - Storing "2025-12-10" vs "2025-12-10T00:00:00" affects query performance
6. **UI/UX alignment** - LocalDate → DatePicker, LocalDateTime → DateTimePicker (different UI components)

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- All 40 tests passing
- Tests updated to use LocalDate for date-only fields
- Tests still use LocalDateTime for timestamp fields
- Type safety enforced at compile time

### PR Review Comments Addressed
✅ **Critical: API Compatibility** - Added desugaring for java.time support
✅ **Missing @NonNull** - User.updatedAt already had @NonNull annotation
✅ **Inconsistent Field Types** - Fixed weightDate, targetDate, achievedDate to use LocalDate

## [2025-12-10] Feature: Add equals/hashCode & Javadoc - Completed

### Work Completed
**equals() and hashCode() Implementation:**
- Added to User model (based on userId primary key)
- Added to WeightEntry model (based on weightId primary key)
- Added to GoalWeight model (based on goalId primary key)

**Javadoc Documentation:**
- Added field-level Javadoc to all model fields
- Security warnings for passwordHash and salt fields
- Format specifications (E.164 for phoneNumber)
- Nullability explanations
- Business rule notes (e.g., "only one active goal per user")

**Test Coverage:**
- Added 6 equals/hashCode tests for User
- Added 3 equals/hashCode tests for WeightEntry
- Added 3 equals/hashCode tests for GoalWeight
- **Total: 52 tests (22 User + 14 WeightEntry + 16 GoalWeight)**
- All tests passing

### Rationale

#### 1. equals() and hashCode() Implementation
**Issue**: Model classes lacked equals() and hashCode(), causing:
- Cannot use models reliably in Collections (Set, HashMap)
- Cannot compare model instances properly
- DAO tests would fail when comparing retrieved vs expected objects
- Violates Java equals/hashCode contract

**Solution**: Implemented equals() and hashCode() based on primary key

**Design Decision - Primary Key Equality:**
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    User user = (User) o;
    return userId == user.userId;  // Compare by primary key only
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Long.hashCode(userId);  // Hash by primary key only
}
```

**Why Primary Key Only?**
- Database semantics: Two records with same ID are the same entity
- Mutable fields: Other fields can change, but ID remains constant
- Collection consistency: User with userId=42 should always hash to same bucket
- DAO tests: Retrieved object equals original if IDs match

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Can use in HashSet, HashMap, etc.
- ✅ DAO tests: `assertEquals(expectedUser, retrievedUser)` works
- ✅ Consistent with database entity semantics
- ✅ Follows Java best practices for entity classes

#### 2. Javadoc Documentation
**Issue**: No field-level documentation, unclear which fields are:
- Security-sensitive (passwordHash, salt)
- Required for specific features (phoneNumber for SMS)
- Format-specific (E.164 phone numbers)
- Business rule constrained (one active goal per user)

**Solution**: Added comprehensive field-level Javadoc

**Critical Documentation Examples:**
```java
/**
 * SHA-256 hashed password for authentication.
 * NEVER store, log, or transmit plain text passwords.
 */
@NonNull private String passwordHash;

/**
 * Optional phone number for SMS notifications in E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567).
 * Required for SMS notification features (FR-5).
 */
@Nullable private String phoneNumber;

/** Active status - only one goal per user can be active at a time */
private boolean isActive;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Self-documenting code
- ✅ Security reminders (never log passwordHash/salt)
- ✅ Format specifications (E.164 phone numbers)
- ✅ Business rules documented at field level
- ✅ Better IDE auto-complete hints
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers

### Lessons Learned
1. **equals/hashCode are not optional** - Any class used in Collections needs these
2. **Primary key equality is standard for entities** - Don't compare all fields
3. **Javadoc prevents security mistakes** - "NEVER log this" warnings help developers
4. **Format specs belong in Javadoc** - E.164 phone format documented at field level
5. **TDD for equals/hashCode** - Test edge cases (null, same instance, same ID different data)
6. **Business rules in documentation** - "One active goal per user" documented at field level

### Technical Debt
None identified

### Test Coverage
- User: 22 tests (16 fields + 6 equals/hashCode)
- WeightEntry: 14 tests (11 fields + 3 equals/hashCode)
- GoalWeight: 16 tests (13 fields + 3 equals/hashCode)
- **Total: 52 tests passing** (up from 40)

### PR Review Comments Addressed
✅ **Missing equals/hashCode** - Implemented for all models based on primary keys
✅ **Inconsistent Javadoc** - Added field-level documentation for all fields
✅ **Security documentation** - Added warnings for passwordHash and salt fields
