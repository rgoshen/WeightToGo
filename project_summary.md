## [2025-11-29] Phase 2: Login Screen - Completed

### Work Completed
- Created `activity_login.xml` with complete login/registration UI including:
  - Gradient header with app logo, name ("Weigh to Go!"), and tagline
  - Tab toggle for switching between Sign In and Create Account modes
  - Username input field with ic_profile icon
  - Password input field with ic_lock icon and password visibility toggle
  - Password field uses `inputType="textPassword"` to display dots (rubric requirement)
  - Forgot Password link with proper touch target (48dp)
  - Sign In button (primary, filled style)
  - "or continue with" divider
  - Create Account button (secondary, outlined style)
  - Terms and Privacy footer text

### Issues Encountered
1. **Icon overlap with hint text** - Initially used `app:startIconDrawable` with floating hints, causing icons to overlap with hint text inside the input fields

### Corrections Made
1. Added `app:expandedHintEnabled="false"` to TextInputLayout to keep hints as labels above the input box rather than floating inside, preventing overlap with start icons
2. Changed username icon from `ic_person` to `ic_profile` for better visual consistency with the app's icon set

### Lessons Learned
- When using `startIconDrawable` in Material TextInputLayout, use `app:expandedHintEnabled="false"` to prevent hint text from overlapping with the icon
- Existing PNG icons across density folders work well - no need to create new vector drawables

### Technical Debt
None identified
