## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Logcat Filtering

Monitor SMS activity in real-time:

```bash
# General SMS logging
adb logcat -s SMSNotificationManager

# Achievement integration
adb logcat -s AchievementManager WeightEntryActivity

# Daily reminders
adb logcat -s DailyReminderWorker

# Permission changes
adb logcat -s SettingsActivity

# All WeightToGo logs
adb logcat | grep "weightogo"
```

### Common Issues

#### Issue: SMS Not Received

**Symptoms:** App logs "SMS sent successfully" but no SMS received

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Carrier delay** - SMS can take 1-5 minutes
2. **Wrong phone number** - Verify E.164 format in database
3. **Carrier blocking** - Some carriers block app-originated SMS
4. **Device SMS limits** - Android limits SMS per hour

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Check phone number in database
adb shell "run-as weightogo cat databases/weigh_to_go.db" | strings | grep "+1"

# Verify SMS permission
adb shell dumpsys package weightogo| grep SEND_SMS

# Check SmsManager logs
adb logcat -s SmsManager
```

#### Issue: Permission Not Granted

**Symptoms:** Permission dialog appears but app still shows "Required"

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Logcat for permission result:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s SettingsActivity | grep "permission"
   ```

2. Verify permission in system:
   ```bash
   adb shell dumpsys package weightogo| grep "android.permission.SEND_SMS"
   # Should show: granted=true
   ```

3. Clear app data and retry:
   ```bash
   adb shell pm clear weightogo   ```

#### Issue: Daily Reminder Not Firing

**Symptoms:** Reminder toggle ON but no SMS at 9:00 AM

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check WorkManager status:
   ```bash
   adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler | grep "weightogo"
   ```

2. Verify reminder preference:
   ```bash
   adb shell "run-as weightogo cat databases/weigh_to_go.db" | strings | grep "sms_reminder_enabled"
   # Should show: sms_reminder_enabled|true
   ```

3. Force WorkManager execution (requires debug build):
   ```bash
   # Trigger WorkManager test mode
   adb shell am broadcast -a androidx.work.impl.background.systemalarm.RescheduleReceiver
   ```

4. Check DailyReminderWorker logs:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s DailyReminderWorker
   # Should see: "doWork: Daily reminder worker started"
   ```

#### Issue: Toggles Not Persisting

**Symptoms:** Toggle states reset after app restart

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify UserPreferenceDAO saves:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s UserPreferenceDAO | grep "setPreference"
   # Should see: "Successfully saved preference: sms_notifications_enabled"
   ```

2. Check database writes:
   ```bash
   adb shell "run-as weightogo cat databases/weigh_to_go.db" | strings | grep "sms_"
   ```

3. Verify SessionManager has valid userId:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s SessionManager | grep "getCurrentUserId"
   # Should NOT return -1
   ```

#### Issue: Achievement SMS Not Sent

**Symptoms:** Achievement logged but no SMS received

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify AchievementManager integration:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s WeightEntryActivity | grep "Achievement"
   # Should see: "Achievement SMS sent: GOAL_REACHED"
   ```

2. Check SMS manager conditions:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s SMSNotificationManager | grep "canSendSms"
   # Should return true
   ```

3. Verify preference toggles:
   ```bash
   adb shell "run-as weightogo cat databases/weigh_to_go.db" | strings | grep "sms_goal_alerts"
   # Should show: sms_goal_alerts|true
   ```

### Performance Monitoring

Check SMS sending performance:

```bash
# Monitor SMS sending time
adb logcat -v time -s SMSNotificationManager | grep "sendGoalAchievedSms"

# Expected output:
# 12-12 09:15:30.123 I/SMSNotificationManager: sendGoalAchievedSms: Sending SMS to +12025551234
# 12-12 09:15:30.456 I/SMSNotificationManager: SMS sent successfully
# Time difference should be < 500ms
```

### Database Inspection

Pull and inspect database for debugging:

```bash
# Pull database
adb pull /data/data/weightogodatabases/weigh_to_go.db

# Open with sqlite3
sqlite3 weigh_to_go.db

# Check phone numbers
SELECT user_id, phone_number FROM users WHERE phone_number IS NOT NULL;

# Check preferences
SELECT user_id, preference_key, preference_value
FROM user_preferences
WHERE preference_key LIKE 'sms%';

# Check achievements
SELECT user_id, achievement_type, notified, achieved_at
FROM achievements
ORDER BY achieved_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Known Limitations

### Robolectric Testing Limitations
- **Issue:** 3 SMS tests fail with Robolectric due to SmsManager mocking limitations
- **Files Affected:** `SMSNotificationManagerTest.java`, `DailyReminderWorkerTest.java`
- **Workaround:** Manual testing required for actual SMS delivery
- **Status:** Expected failures documented in test output

### Material3 Incompatibility
- **Issue:** 25 SettingsActivity tests @Ignored due to Robolectric/Material3 theme incompatibility
- **GitHub Issue:** #12
- **Resolution:** Will migrate to Espresso instrumented tests in Phase 8.4
- **Workaround:** Manual testing covers SettingsActivity functionality

### Android Version Differences
- **Android 13+ (API 33+):** Requires POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission for SMS delivery
- **Android 12 and below:** Only SEND_SMS permission required
- **Testing:** Ensure both permission types are granted on Android 13+ devices

### SMS Delivery Timing
- **Carrier delays:** SMS may take 1-5 minutes to deliver
- **Rate limiting:** Android limits SMS to prevent spam (varies by device/carrier)
- **Background restrictions:** Daily reminders may be delayed if device in battery saver mode

### Emulator Limitations
- **Cannot send real SMS:** Emulators lack cellular modem
- **SmsManager returns success:** Even though no SMS sent
- **Testing scope:** Limited to UI, validation, database operations

### WorkManager Execution Timing
- **Scheduled time:** 9:00 AM is target, but may execute ±15 minutes
- **Flex interval:** 1-hour flex interval allows Android to optimize battery
- **Constraints:** May delay if battery low or device not idle
- **Testing:** Time manipulation may not reliably trigger WorkManager
