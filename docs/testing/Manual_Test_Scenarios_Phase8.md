# Manual Test Scenarios - Phase 8

## Overview

This document contains manual test scenarios for features that cannot be automated with Espresso due to framework limitations. These tests must be executed manually on a real Android device.

**Espresso Limitations:**
- Cannot verify Toast message content (GH #49)
- Cannot interact with system permission dialogs
- Cannot test actual SMS sending (requires real SIM card)
- Cannot test push notifications (system-level)
- Cannot test WorkManager time-based execution (requires waiting hours)

**Test Environment Requirements:**
- Real Android device (not emulator) for SMS tests
- Android 13+ device for notification permission tests
- Active SIM card for SMS sending tests
- Test phone number configured in Settings

---

## Test Execution Instructions

For each test scenario:
1. Follow the **Test Steps** in order
2. Record **Actual Result** in the provided column
3. Mark test as **PASS** if actual matches expected, **FAIL** otherwise
4. For failures, document the issue in **Notes** column

**Status Legend:**
- ☐ Not Started
- ✓ PASS
- ✗ FAIL

## 2. SMS Permission Dialog Handling

**Purpose:** Verify that system permission dialogs appear and are handled correctly.

| 2.2 Grant Permission | 1. Trigger permission dialog<br>2. Click "Allow" in system dialog | - Dialog closes<br>- Status badge changes to "Granted" (green checkmark)<br>- Button changes to "Revoke Permission" | | ☐ | |
| 2.3 Deny Permission | 1. Trigger permission dialog<br>2. Click "Deny" in system dialog | - Dialog closes<br>- Status badge changes to "Denied" (red X)<br>- Button remains "Grant Permission" | | ☐ | |
| 2.4 Deny with "Don't Ask Again" | 1. Trigger permission dialog<br>2. Check "Don't ask again"<br>3. Click "Deny" | - Dialog closes<br>- Status badge shows "Denied"<br>- Button disabled or shows "Open Settings" | | ☐ | |

## 3. Actual SMS Sending (Real Device Required)

**Purpose:** Verify that SMS messages are sent correctly to configured phone number.

**Prerequisites:**
- Real Android device with active SIM card
- Test phone number configured in Settings
- Access to phone number to receive SMS

| Test Case | Test Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 Send Test SMS | 1. Open Settings<br>2. Configure phone number<br>3. Click "Send Test Message" button | SMS received on configured phone:<br>"Test message from Weigh to Go!" | | ☐ | Record phone number used:<br><br>SMS timestamp: |
| 3.2 Goal Achieved SMS | 1. Set goal weight to 150.0 lbs<br>2. Add weight entry of 150.0 lbs<br>3. System detects goal achieved | SMS received:<br>"Congratulations! You've reached your goal weight of 150.0 lbs!" | | ☐ | Record actual SMS text:<br><br>Timestamp: |
| 3.3 Milestone Reached SMS | 1. Add weight entries to reach 5 lbs lost<br>2. System detects milestone | SMS received:<br>"Great progress! You've lost 5.0 lbs. Keep it up!" | | ☐ | Record actual SMS text:<br><br>Timestamp: |

## 4. Push Notification Permission (Android 13+)

**Purpose:** Verify that notification permission is requested and notifications work correctly on Android 13+.

**Prerequisites:**
- Android 13 (API 33) or higher device

| Test Case | Test Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 Notification Permission Dialog (Android 13+) | 1. Install app on Android 13+ device<br>2. Open app for first time | System permission dialog appears requesting notification access | | ☐ | Android version:<br><br>API level: |

## 5. Daily Reminder Scheduling (WorkManager)

**Purpose:** Verify that WorkManager correctly schedules and executes daily reminder tasks.

**Background:** Cannot test time-based execution in automated tests (requires waiting hours).
