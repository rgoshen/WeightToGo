);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON users(email) WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Table 2: `daily_weights`
**Purpose**: Store daily weight entries for all users

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `weight_id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT | Unique identifier for each weight entry |
| `user_id` | INTEGER | NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY | Reference to users table |
| `weight_value` | REAL | NOT NULL | Weight value in user's preferred unit |

**Sample SQL**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_weights (
    weight_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    weight_value REAL NOT NULL,
    weight_unit TEXT DEFAULT 'lbs',
    entry_date TEXT NOT NULL,

    is_deleted INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(user_id, entry_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_weights ON daily_weights(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_date ON daily_weights(user_id, entry_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_active_weights ON daily_weights(user_id, is_deleted);
```

```

#### SMS Utility Class
```java
public class SmsNotificationUtils {
    
    /**
     * Check if device can send SMS
     */
    public static boolean canSendSms(Context context) {
        return context.getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY);
    }

     * Send SMS using Android SmsManager
     */
    public static boolean sendSms(String phoneNumber, String message) {
        try {
            SmsManager smsManager = SmsManager.getDefault();
            
            // Handle long messages
            if (message.length() > 160) {

            return "+" + defaultCountryCode + cleaned;
        }
        return cleaned;
    }
}
```

#### Daily Reminder Scheduler
```java
public class SmsReminderScheduler {
    private static final int REMINDER_REQUEST_CODE = 2001;
    
    /**
     * Schedule daily SMS reminder
     */
    public static void scheduleReminder(Context context, int hour, int minute) {
        AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager) context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
        Intent intent = new Intent(context, SmsReminderReceiver.class);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
            context, 
            REMINDER_REQUEST_CODE, 
            intent, 
            PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT | PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        );
        
        // Set reminder time
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, hour);
        calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, minute);
        calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
        
        // If time has passed today, schedule for tomorrow
        if (calendar.getTimeInMillis() <= System.currentTimeMillis()) {
            calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, 1);
        }
        
        // Schedule repeating alarm
        alarmManager.setRepeating(
            AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
            calendar.getTimeInMillis(),
            AlarmManager.INTERVAL_DAY,
            pendingIntent
        );
    }
    
    /**
     * Cancel scheduled reminder
     */
    public static void cancelReminder(Context context) {
        AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager) context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
        Intent intent = new Intent(context, SmsReminderReceiver.class);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
            context, 
            REMINDER_REQUEST_CODE, 
            intent, 
            PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT | PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        );
        alarmManager.cancel(pendingIntent);
    }
}
```

**Notification Trigger Points**:
- After user saves a new weight entry → check goal achievement and milestones
- Compare latest weight against goal weight
- Consider direction (loss vs. gain) based on relationship between starting weight and goal
- Check user preferences before sending any SMS
- Record notification/SMS sent status to prevent duplicates

### Tech-4: Input Validation

#### Validation Rules
- **Username**: 
  - Not empty
  - Length: 3-20 characters
  - Alphanumeric characters only
  - Must be unique in database
  
- **Password**: 
  - Not empty
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - Must match confirmation password (during registration)
  
- **Phone Number**:
  - Optional field
  - If provided, must be valid E.164 format
  - Example: +15551234567
  - Max 15 digits after country code
  
- **Weight Value**:
  - Not empty
  - Positive number
  - Reasonable range: 1-1000 lbs or 0.5-500 kg
  - Maximum 2 decimal places
  
- **Date**:
  - Valid date format
  - Not in the future
  - Not before reasonable start date (e.g., not before 1900)

### Tech-5: Data Persistence

#### SharedPreferences (for app settings and session)
```java
// Store user session
SharedPreferences prefs = getSharedPreferences("WeighToGoPrefs", MODE_PRIVATE);
prefs.edit()
    .putInt("current_user_id", userId)
    .putString("username", username)
    .putBoolean("is_logged_in", true)
    .apply();

// Note: User-specific preferences stored in user_preferences table
// SharedPreferences used only for session management
```

#### SQLite Database (for user data)
- All user, weight, goal, achievement, and preference data stored in SQLite
- Database persists across app restarts
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Cascading deletes for data integrity

---

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### SEC-1: Password Security
**Priority**: Critical

**Requirements**:
- Passwords must be hashed using SHA-256 with unique salt
- Never store plain-text passwords
- Generate cryptographically secure random salt for each user
- Salt stored separately from hash

**Implementation**:
```java
public class PasswordUtils {
    
    public static String generateSalt() {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[32];
        random.nextBytes(salt);
        return Base64.encodeToString(salt, Base64.NO_WRAP);
    }
    
    public static String hashPassword(String password, String salt) {
        try {
            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
            String saltedPassword = password + salt;
            byte[] hash = digest.digest(saltedPassword.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
            return Base64.encodeToString(hash, Base64.NO_WRAP);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("SHA-256 not available", e);
        }
    }
    
    public static boolean verifyPassword(String password, String salt, String storedHash) {
        String computedHash = hashPassword(password, salt);
        return computedHash.equals(storedHash);
    }
}
```

### SEC-2: User Data Isolation
**Priority**: Critical

**Requirements**:
- Each user can only access their own data
- All database queries must filter by current user_id
- Enforce foreign key constraints
- Use ON DELETE CASCADE to ensure data integrity
- Validate user_id on all operations

### SEC-3: Input Sanitization
**Priority**: High

**Requirements**:
- Sanitize all user inputs before database operations
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate data types and ranges
- Escape special characters in display

**Example**:
```java
// CORRECT - Using parameterized queries
String query = "INSERT INTO daily_weights (user_id, weight_value, entry_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
SQLiteStatement statement = db.compileStatement(query);
statement.bindLong(1, userId);
statement.bindDouble(2, weight);
statement.bindString(3, date);
statement.executeInsert();

// WRONG - Never concatenate user input into queries
// String query = "INSERT INTO daily_weights VALUES (" + userId + ", " + weight + ", '" + date + "')";
```

### SEC-4: Session Management
**Priority**: High

**Requirements**:
- Implement proper session timeout
- Clear session data on logout
- Secure session storage using SharedPreferences
- Validate session on app resume
- Update last_login timestamp

### SEC-5: SMS Security
**Priority**: High

**Requirements**:
- Store phone numbers securely in database
- Validate phone number format before storage
- Request SMS permission only when needed (just-in-time)
- Provide clear explanation for permission request
- Handle permission denial gracefully
- Do not send SMS without explicit user opt-in
- Log all SMS attempts for audit purposes
- Respect user's notification preferences

**Permission Handling**:
```java
// Check permission
if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS) 
        != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
    
    // Show rationale if needed
    if (ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(this, Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS)) {
        showPermissionRationaleDialog();
    } else {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, 
            new String[]{Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS}, 
            SMS_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE);
    }
} else {
    // Permission already granted
    enableSmsFeatures();
}
```
