## 📏 Code Style Guidelines

### Java Style Guide

We follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) with these specifics:

#### Naming Conventions

```java
// Classes: PascalCase
public class WeightEntryActivity { }

// Methods: camelCase (verb phrases)
public void saveWeightEntry() { }

// Variables: camelCase
private float currentWeight;

// Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
public static final int MAX_WEIGHT = 1000;

// Layout IDs: snake_case with type prefix
// button_save, text_weight_display, edit_password

// Resource files: snake_case
// activity_main.xml, item_weight_history.xml
```

#### Code Organization

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    // 1. Constants
    private static final String TAG = "ExampleActivity";
    
    // 2. Static fields
    private static int instanceCount = 0;
    
    // 3. Instance fields (UI elements first, then data)
    private Button btnSave;
    private EditText etWeight;
    private WeightDAO weightDAO;
    
    // 4. Lifecycle methods (in order)
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { }
    
    @Override
    protected void onResume() { }
    
    @Override
    protected void onPause() { }
    
    // 5. UI initialization
    private void initViews() { }
    
    private void setupListeners() { }
    
    // 6. Business logic methods
    private void saveWeight() { }
    
    private void validateInput() { }
    
    // 7. Helper/utility methods
    private String formatWeight(float weight) { }
}
```

#### Comments

```java
// Use Javadoc for public methods
/**
 * Saves the weight entry to the database.
 *
 * @param weight The weight value in the user's preferred unit
 * @param date   The date of the weight entry
 * @return true if save was successful, false otherwise
 */
public boolean saveWeightEntry(float weight, String date) { }

// Use inline comments sparingly, for complex logic
// Calculate progress percentage (avoid division by zero)
float progress = (startWeight - currentWeight) / Math.max(startWeight - goalWeight, 0.1f);
```

### XML Layout Guidelines

```xml
<!-- Use consistent attribute ordering -->
<Button
    android:id="@+id/btn_save"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginStart="16dp"
    android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"
    android:text="@string/save"
    android:textColor="@color/white"
    android:background="@drawable/btn_primary" />

<!-- Attribute order:
     1. android:id
     2. android:layout_width, layout_height
     3. android:layout_* (margins, constraints)
     4. android:* (other android attrs)
     5. app:* (custom/library attrs)
     6. tools:* (design-time attrs)
-->
```

### Resource Naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Layout | `<type>_<description>` | `activity_login.xml` |
| Drawable | `<type>_<description>` | `ic_weight.xml`, `bg_card.xml` |
| String | `<screen>_<description>` | `login_title`, `dashboard_greeting` |
| Color | `<description>` | `primary_teal`, `text_secondary` |
| Dimen | `<type>_<description>` | `margin_standard`, `text_headline` |
