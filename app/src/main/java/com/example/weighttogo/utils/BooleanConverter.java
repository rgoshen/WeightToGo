 * Utility class for converting between Java boolean and SQLite INTEGER (0/1).

 * SQLite does not have a native BOOLEAN type. By convention, INTEGER values are used:
 * - 0 represents false
 * - 1 (or any non-zero value) represents true
 *
 * This converter ensures consistent boolean ↔ INTEGER conversion across the application.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - DAO layer: Convert boolean to INTEGER before database operations
 * - Model layer: Convert INTEGER to boolean after database queries
 *
 * This is a utility class with only static methods. It is declared final and has a private
 * constructor to prevent instantiation and inheritance.
